Welcome! ${username}

Here are your AWS API Access credentials.
Some data has been encrypted using your Keybase public key for safety.

AWS Access Key ID: ${access_key_id}
AWS Secret Access Key:

To decrypt your AWS Secret Access Key, run the following command in your terminal app:
```
${secret_decrypt_command}
```


Configuring the AWS CLI

If you have run UnionPOS Baseline provisioning tool the aws cli application should already be installed.
The aws configure command is generally the fastest way to set up your AWS CLI access credentials.

Open Terminal app and execute the following command

```sh
aws configure
```

You will be prompted for your credentials and default preferences.
The following example shows sample values.
Replace them with your own values as described above.

```sh
$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: ${access_key_id}
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: paste your decrypted secret access key here
Default region name [None]: us-west-2
Default output format [None]: json
```

If you receive the message `command not found` then the aws cli software is not installed.

Follow the links below for instructions on installing and configuring AWS CLI access software

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html

verify your configuration by pasting the following command in terminal

```sh
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

if your configuration is correct the command should return the following

```sh
{
    "UserId": "${access_key_id}",
    "Account": "731646523614",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::731646523614:user/users/${username}"
}
```
